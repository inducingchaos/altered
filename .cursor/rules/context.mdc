My name is Riley, and I am building ALTERED, a digital knowledge management tool that stores your thoughts in a database, allows you to organize/manipulate them, and use them via Systems, which are mini-apps for your ALTERED brain.

I want to design + build systems (apps, even devices) to capture (ingest), control (organize to perfection), scale (infinite retrieval & strategic versioning), and utilize (output/review anything) your personal thoughts. Store → Transform → Use, with impossible efficiency. (ALTERED: Knowledge Systems for the Obsessed)

We are essentially extending the brain. By reverse-engineering neurological linking concepts into data manipulation and indexing functions, storing and aggregating data using such tools, and then creating tangible or actionable outputs from your data (like reminders to keep a schedule, generating a website or course, planning out a marketing campaign with your best ideas)... we are able to persist and recall infinite memory via intelligent indexing and retrieval methods (where a human brain forgets entirely, or certain details, and cannot clearly/absolutely compare or refine data), as well as utilize this data for any kind of output imaginable and designable from the basis of technology (think sending emails/SMS, posting social content, push notifications to devices, creating a payment within a payment processor or hitting any other API, transforming other data via AI prompting or raw manipulation using your stored data, or even IoT cases that integrate with hardware in the real world). The possibilities are truly endless. By offloading our psychic entropy (thoughts, intentions, etc.) to this app, and then applying control (organization, versioning, assigning functionality and schedules) - even without AI integrations and agentic workflows, we are basically already creating a thought-to-action toolkit. Even just the ability to compare attributes of different thoughts (think columns in Sheets or of a real database) can be extremely useful when orientated for purely thinking purposes - the closest thing to this is Notion databases but they have way too much customizability (without the versioning to support it - this is organizational overhead), not enough schema enforcement, they use directory-based file organization rather than a flat tag-based indexing system - and just too much opinionated bloat to be called minimalistic. The best analogy I can think of to describe this gap is the topic of Component libraries in Typescript - some options like Radix provide production-ready, optimized primitives (unstyled), other options like MUI come prebuilt and installable as a package which limits customization, and something like shadcn/ui bridges the gap, providing the best of both worlds - offering Radix as a foundation with copy/paste styled components that you can edit directly. Notion feels something like MUI, where we might be forced to have a "Name" col in the database, see icons for each col, to have a page assigned to each row, not be able to sync column visibility between views... and then there's Sheets or a CSV, which are like Radix - provide the base concepts but not much more. We want to be the shadcn/ui of data software. A solid, sensible base (for managing thoughts in a database), but extendable via Dataset Schemas, Systems, Interfaces (A UI that you can use to visually construct systems), and more. So just that alone can be incredibly useful for comparing content ideas, tagging photos or media, tracking/labelling notes, and versioning them all with conditional or scheduled expirations for review or archival. Being data-first (rather than function-first), this is definitely a generalist app (like ChatGPT, or Google - not constrained to a specific use case of problem, but instead solves a problem for everyone) instead of specializing for a niche (like a reminders app, or something to aggregate business ideas), and while that might be less-optimal from a business startup efficiency perspective - I believe it offers even more opportunity to refine the product for what it's meant for, all of someone's personal thoughts and the implementation of them - and by doing so I can focus more on the diverse use cases I have in my own life, and generalize the app to support each of them uniformly.
