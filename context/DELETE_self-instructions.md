[Chat title: Build a dashboard with data table]

LOOK AT POSTER ON WALL.

We can refine rest of table, branding, etc... don't go overboard.

**REST OF FEATURES FOR EARLY ACCESS IN RAYCAST EXT**.

Consider hiding table page on mobile to avoid layout issues.

Get feature branch to mergeable state - **it is worth it, because the design and basic features of the table dictate the future of the app**. We also want the extra schemas merged.

MCP server for self-context?? Load up context window LOL
