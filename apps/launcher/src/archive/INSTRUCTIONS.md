This branch is leftover code for developing the Interface adapter, and it's sub-adapters for operations, components, state, and more. In addition, there are functions for resolving keypaths (that we will most likely discard, but maybe use the concept) and others.

See LATEST_CHAT.md for starting to work through these, problem by problem. Once we have re-implemented all functionality we can delete the files.
